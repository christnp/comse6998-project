# Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)

This directory provides PyTorch code that was used to address the zero-shot learning (ZSL) application. The primary codebase can be credited to Li et al. and can be found on their public GitHub [repository](https://github.com/kailigo/cvcZSL) (Apache 2.0 License). The primary codebase was modified to meet the goals defined in the top level [README](../README.md). All other code used for ZSL is either original or cited as a comment in-line.
